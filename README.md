# Team Generator Project

## Problem
There are many team generator websites out there. I've checked some and found the same problems:
- They have ads. I show these pages to kids when I make teams in my classrooms.
- They don't let me save lists of students. Setting up and switching between classes eats class time.

## Solution
I want a team generator that doesn't have ads and lets me save lists of students.

## For those who want to self host
The tech stack is simple:

- Python
- Fastapi
- SQLite

All you need to do is clone this, modify it as you wish, and host it somewhere.

## Set up
```
git clone repo-name team-generator
cd team-generator
python3 -m venv venv
which python
pip install -r requirements
fastapi dev main.py
```

## For those who just want to make a few teams
Website coming soon.
